# **Nami Budget Tracker**

Welcome to Nami's Workout Tracker!


## Description

Nami has to track the crew's budget, and being out at sea, sometimes you won't be able to connect to the internet. This app will allow you to go out to sea and still use the application!

### **Tasks completed**

Created a budget tracker using node.js and monogodb that is a PWA.

## User Story

```
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```

## Business Context

```
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
```
